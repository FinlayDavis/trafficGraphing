# trafficGraphing
A small app which imports user downloaded UK Gov Road Traffic Statistics files, and can graph key columns or metrics.

UK Gov Website - https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/#6/55.254/-6.064/basemap-regions-countpoints

Once the raw data files have been downloaded, they can be found using the "Browse" button.

From here the user can choose which column you want to graph, which direction, and also compare the percentage of one to the other.

Additionally, the filtered data can be saved to a .csv file of your choice. Simply choose a file location and name, then press "Save" in the GUI.

If two columns have been selected to compare, then the perentage difference between column 2 and column 1 is displayed. This will go on to be saved on the .csv file as well.
